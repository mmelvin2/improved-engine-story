Edward Scissorhands had always loved crowded Amsterdam with its tricky, tired trees. It was a place where he felt anxious.

He was a charming, intuitive, tea drinker with red eyes. His friends saw him as a pretty, putrid painter. Once, he had even helped a bad baby flamingo recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was.

Edward walked over to the window and reflected on his bright surroundings. The sleet rained like jogging tortoises.

Edward did not mind the weather, he found it to be peaceful. He sat by the window a while, contemplating what he might do when the precipitation stopped.
